Obviously this is a FizzBuzz game for Android

This is the game description http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz
(note that "Adults may play Fizz Buzz as a drinking game, where making a mistake leads to the player having to make a drinking-related forfeit.")

App looks like this:

Is it really that fun?

No, I just wanted to create a simple Android app.
But may be with voice recognition it will be...
